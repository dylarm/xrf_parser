Process PDZ files

Many current implementations of using information gathered from XRF devices are
complicated and meant for *any* usage, such as PyXRF, and may be difficult to
run on certain platforms, such as Windows.
This project aims to provide a simple usage: read the PDZ files produced from a
given handheld XRF device, and produce certain statistics and information.
